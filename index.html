                        <h2>CRUD Operation Web App</h2>
                        <p>As a front-end developer, one must be familiar with basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations.</p>
                        <p>A To-Do List or a Notes webpage are two examples of CRUD applications.</p>
                        <p>Because CRUD apps require the usage of reusable components, this web app was developed using frameworks like React and Vue.</p>

                        <h2>Music Player</h2>
                        <p>The architecture for this music player is divided into two main thematic parts: CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>CSS for adding styling to each element defined in the HTML file;</p>
                        <p>And JavaScript for adding elements for audio, player buttons, and music information.</p>

                        <h2>QR Code Reader</h2>
                        <p>This project uses a JS library which decodes the QR code.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to popular belief, one does not require a native phone app to read QR codes.</p>
                        <p>Websites that operate on a smart device with a camera may be able to accomplish this.</p>

                        <p>AngularJS was also employed to present the information in a pleasing manner.</p>

                        <p>This landing page was created by exploring Bootstrap's capabilites.</p>
                        <p>Bootstrap streamlines any front-end developer's job and boosts their outputs.</p>
                        <p>The user's time and name can be displayed from local storage.</p>

                        <p>This calculator project can perform basic arithmetic functionalites like addition and multiplication.</p>
                        <p>The user interface was designed with buttons and a display screen.</p>
                        <p>CSS Grid was used to align the buttons and the screen.</p>

                        <p>The component was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.</p>

                        <p>Users can navigate to previous and next months by clicking on buttons or arrows.</p>
                        <p>It can also save events in local storage, so they persist between page reloads.</p>

                        <p>Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming e.g. developing  apps and building websites.</p>
                        <p>Hailing from the BS Computer Science degree program of UPLB and being invited to join my friend's start-up company, I gained experience in these areas.</p>
                        <p>I am keen to gain more experience in this field. For this reason I am looking for a company to offer me a placement among their developers, specifically as a front-end software engineer.</p>
