# Key Takeaways:
# - in designing a webpage, it is advised to layout everything first (flex, grid, etc) before inserting values (text, images, etc) so as to speed up the process
# - flexbox is a challenging CSS layout module to learn, but it is extremely helpful in controlling how webpage elements behave
# - exploring the different styling options that CSS has to offer is important in enhancing user-navigation-experience and overall website aesthetics
